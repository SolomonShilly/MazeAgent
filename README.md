# Maze Solver

This project implements two algorithms to solve a maze. The algorithms used are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). 

## Maze Representation

The maze is represented as a 2D list:

- `0` = free space (the agent can move here)
- `1` = wall (the agent cannot move here)

## Features

- Visual representation of the maze
- Pathfinding using BFS and DFS
- Time comparison between both algorithms

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `maze_solver.py` file
